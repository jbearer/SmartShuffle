# SmartShuffle
An mp3 player with an improved, contextual shuffling algorithm

While listening to Google Play music, I noticed that the shuffle algorithm seemed unsatisfactory. I was constantly skipping songs, and yet those songs kept recurring over and over again. Wouldn't it be great if, when you skipped a song, your music player took note of that and then avoided playing similar songs? That, and other context aware methods of randomization, will -- eventually -- form the basis of SmartShuffle.
